- **Description:** `JobNest` is a job searching website where you can easily add a job, also you can apply a job. This system is now under construction again because I am updating this site and going to implement `Admin Panel` system

- Three layer of Authorization `Admin` - `Host` - `General`
- `Admin` can manage everything
- `Host` can add job and review his/her added jobs
- `Admin` can Change anyone's `Role`
- `Geleral` user can make request to Admin to be the Host
- You can login by `Google`
- Just select the `Photo`, No need of Photo URL
- You can `Create a Job` Post
- You can `Edit & Delete` your created Job Post
- You can `visit & edit` you profile
- you will be `notified by a E-mail` after applying a Job
- You can `download the PDF` of your Applied Job
- You can see your `posted job` and `applied job` Separately
